## Getting started

Felfire Google Cloud Storage is part of the [Felfire](https://github.com/nicolascava/felfire) plugin ecosystem.

## Why Felfire Google Cloud Storage?

Felfire Google Cloud Storage is a plugin that takes compiled sources from a Felfire app or website then deploy it to a specified Google Cloud Storage bucket.
 
Its purpose is to simplify the developer experience on deployment pipelines.

## Command

Felfire Google Cloud Storage will take sources from the build directory (e.q. `buildDir` from Felfire's configuration) to do its deployment process:

```bash
felfire google-cloud-storage [--env=staging]
```

### Option

`--env`: specify on which environment you want to deploy your sources (default to `production`). The second choice is `staging`. If specified, Felfire Google Cloud Storage will prefix your bucket's name with `staging.` (removing `www.` prefix if necessary).

## Custom configuration

Here are the full options explained:

```json
"plugins": [
  ["google-cloud-storage", {
    "bucket": "my-bucket-name",
    "region": "us-west-2"
  }]
]
```
